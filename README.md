This application allows a user to dynamically generate an html file by adding team members, specifically engineers and interns. And the prompts vary based on the user selection whether the user chooses to add an engineer or an intern. It utilizes node modules inquirer and fs in order for the application to capture user input and then to write the data to the html file.

## Getting Started

Open your command terminal and run 'npm install' in order to install the modules needed for this application to run properly. Then run 'node index.js' to start the application, and respond to the given prompts.
